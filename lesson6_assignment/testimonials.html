<h3><em>Underrepresentation</em></h3>
<p>While statistics for women in IT are low, statistics for African American women are even lower. Cofounder of MRelief, Rose Afriyie, said "Growing up, I really didn’t hear about any women in tech, especially black women. Bill Gates, for example, was a name people would mention over and over again. But there really wasn’t an Oprah of technology." Afriyie makes a great point. Where are the females in tech that can represent a subculture? It is up to this generation to produce successful women who will ignite a fire in an ever-growing industry that is severely lacking gender diversity.</p>

<h3><em>Biases</em></h3>
<p>When surrounded by a majority, it is likely that a tech woman will run into biases from anyone. Oftentimes these biases are not malicious, but are solely from subconscious prejudices that they are unaware of. Speaking from my own experience, many times I would explain a policy or procedure to a client, then the client would speak with a male coworker and get the same response. Was my explanation not clear enough? Or did they need to hear it from a man? "But sometimes biases can be hard to avoid. I have friends who have been mansplained or people assume they aren’t technical. I’ve heard a lot of stories where people assume women aren’t engineers and think they are there to take notes in conference meetings," said software engineer intern, Patricia Arbona.</p>

<h3><em>How Do We Avoid This?</em></h3>
<p>Once the problem is identified, we need to look into how to change the future. Women who are in IT have started speaking out and encouraging other women that they are not alone. These women have also developed coding bootcamps, conferences, luncheons, and even scholarships. Organizations like <em>Girls Who Code</em> and <em>TechGirlz</em> have started to change the perception of science and math as masculine fields by "providing young girls with female role models, and giving them hands-on experience with all different kinds of technology." It is important for women be strong and pave a way for younger women to succeed. Change starts with knowing some signs to look for. When speaking with a potential job, be sure to look up how many women are on their team. Ask questions in an interview to get a feel of the company culture for women. Once we make the initiative to be the change and make more people aware, change will come.</p>
